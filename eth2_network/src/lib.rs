//! Traits for abstracting over different Ethereum 2.0 network protocols.
//!
//! Currently only [`BeaconBlock`]s and beacon [`Attestation`]s can be gossiped, because those are
//! the only types of objects supported by Hobbits. Methods for [other types of objects] will be
//! added later.
//!
//! [`Attestation`]: types::types::Attestation
//! [`BeaconBlock`]: types::types::BeaconBlock
//!
//! [other types of objects]: https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/blob/1f3a5b156f7a0e7616f7c8bc31e27fa4da392139/specs/networking/p2p-interface.md#message
